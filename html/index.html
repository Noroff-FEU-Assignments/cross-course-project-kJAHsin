    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">One important step is the validation of input information.  Hackers can sneak script of malicious language through input fields.  So validating that information is important before it is accepted into the database.  A malicious script can attack the site in various ways. Also using security measures that set time and usage limits on the user are helpful.  For example, if a user walks away from their workstation without logging out from important accounts, any person walking by would have the possibility to access possibly sensitive information. Labeling fields in a form can also be helpful in the prevention of cyber attacks.  If someone attempts to write a script into an email field for example, they will not be able to do so if the field requires a proper email address to send in the form.  This process can be further strengthened by using third party validation programs to identify users that are attempting to log in to your sight.  This will further verify that it is an approved user that is attempted to gain access.</p>
